### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a long-time technologist with almost a decade of querying SQL under my belt. I've also had a stint as a web developer using PHP/HTML/CSS. I'm in the middle of making the transition to actively doing something with data instead of just efficiently retrieving it for others.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building out my modern data stack portfolio. I've recently finished the dbt Fundamentals course using BigQuery.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the Mode Analytics platform.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
